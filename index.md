This webpage displays examples of music generated by the MuseRNN model as described in the article "A Distance and Beat-aware Duration and Pitch Mutual Generation Model for Instrumental Music Generation" which submitted to ACM TOMM 2021 (submission ID XXXX).

## Samples

The experiments in this paper perform a music continuation task on the validation set to verify the performance ofthe MuseRNN. Specifically, each piece of music in the validation set is cut equally into two segments of equal length, and the model is asked to output the complete piece of music by continuing the first half.

The MIDI files were rendered using the Guzheng soundfont from GarageBand, and all scores were uniformly performed at the default tempo (bpm=60) and velocity (velocity=90). Thus, we can focus on the differences in the contents of scores without being distracted by the performing style.

One of the music samples in the validation set is shown below, which is an 8-bar sample of traditional Chinese music.

In this test, participants were asked to make a binary judgement based on the audio: 1) the music is generated by artificial intelligence, and 2) the music is genuine traditional Chinese music. Before the test, participants were told that the first half of all the audio was excerpted from traditional Chinese music and that they needed to pay attention towhether the second half was similar to the first half in order to determine whether it was of the same origin. However, they were not informed that how many of the second half of the audio was generated by models. Each participant was asked to complete six listening questions, corresponding to six different music generation models. During the test, participants were allowed to play the audio an unlimited number of times.
