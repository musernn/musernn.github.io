This webpage displays examples of music generated by the DeepClassical model as described in the article "A Model Based on Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Network for Classical Music Generation by Inpainting" which submitted to ACM MM 2021 (submission ID 1140).

## DeepClassical's Generations

These audio samples are used in the discrimination experiments. The MIDI files were rendered using the Strings Staccato soundfont from GarageBand, and all scores were uniformly performed at the default speed (bpm=120) and velocity (velocity=90). Thus, we can focus on the differences in the contents of scores without being distracted by the performing style.


A 42-second extract from BWV 1001.4 Presto is provided as the reference for participants who are unfamiliar with Bach's compositions.

And here is an audio sample generated by DeepClassical based on the reference audio.

In our experiments, participants are randomly presented with three different questions. The three questions, in order, are beginning, middle, and ending discrimination questions, which ask participants to select audio that is considered to be an extract from a piece composed by Bach. Listen to some of the audio samples used in our experiments.

## Beginning

<div align=center>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>J.S. Bach</th>
        <th><audio id="audio" controls="" preload="none">
            <source id="mp3" src="Q1_Bach.mp3">
            </audio></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>DeepClassical</th>
        <th><audio id="audio" controls="" preload="none">
            <source id="mp3" src="Q1_DC.mp3">
            </audio></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>DeepClassical-linear</th>
        <th><audio id="audio" controls="" preload="none">
            <source id="mp3" src="Q1_DCL.mp3">

## Middle

## Ending

More code and dataset will be avaliable soon. :)
